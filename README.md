<em> Weierstrass function </em>
</p>

The goal of this project is to predict the coefficients of a Weierstrass function using a genetic algorithm to converge to the closest solution. The premise is that we have the temperature of a star that seems to variate following a Weierstrass function.

The coefficients are constrained as follows:

In 25 generations we converge to a mean absolute error of 0.03677789351486158.

It takes 2.2 seconds to arrive at this solution.
